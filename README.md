The sentiment module provides methods for returning word-level and
average word sentiment scores, currently for English only.

The sentiment data is from the article Temporal Patterns of Happiness and Information in a Global Social Network: Hedonometrics and Twitter
Peter Sheridan Dodds, Kameron Decker Harris, Isabel M. Kloumann, Catherine A. Bliss, and Christopher M. Danforth

Sentiments range from -1.0 to 1.0, where -1.0 is the most unfavorable, and 1.0 is the most favorable.

In addition, a Sentiment object can be inspected for the original values from the Hedonometrics paper.
